      Tuning into Rider Voices: Community-Centered Solutions for an Equitable MBTA
    </h3>
    <p class="new-paragraph">BOSTON - The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA), known locally as “the T”, is the public transit system serving the Greater Boston area. It operates various subway, bus, commuter rail and ferry routes across eastern Massachusetts. However, after decades of underinvestment and deferred maintenance, the T is now facing an infrastructure crisis.</p>
    <p class="new-paragraph">According to data from the MBTA and other sources, the T’s performance has been steadily declining across numerous metrics.</p>
    <p class="new-paragraph">A recent survey of Emerson College students, who rely heavily on the T to commute to campus, and internships, echoes these issues. With nearly 90% of respondents indicating dissatisfaction with their overall T experience, students criticized slow speeds, long wait times, shuttle buses during repairs, and a lack of communication around delays.</p>

        <div class="slide-text"> 46% said the T only meets their commuting needs sometimes or rarely, and over 75% identified frequent delays, long wait times, and slow service as top complaints. As senior Anansya Latka noted: “the T gets me where I need to go but there is a lot of delays which often end up making the trip as long as it would have been if I had walked."</div>

      The survey results highlight the urgent need to rebuild public trust and deliver more reliable service, goals MBTA General Manager Phillip Eng has vocalized. “Repairing our infrastructure is essential to providing a safe and more reliable trip for our riders,” Eng said in a recent statement about Green Line repair work.</p>
    <p class="new-paragraph">However, students like senior TJ Taylor don’t feel the current repair approach is sustainable: “the constant construction that results in shutdowns really makes things difficult.”</p>
    <h3>A History of Issues</h3>
    <p class="new-paragraph">Historically, the T does not serve every part of Boston equally. After a history of competing with the city of New York to become the first city in America with public transportation, followed by a recent history of malfunctions and shutdowns that led to insufficient commutes across the city, the 'T' undoubtedly has much room for improvement. </p>
    <div class="image-wrap">
      <img src="Assets/Images/Streetcar copy 2.jpeg" alt="OG Streetcar" style="width: 300px;"> </div>
    <p class="new-paragraph">The T’s first electric streetcar debuted on January 1st, 1889, replacing the former stagecoaches (horse-drawn carriages) that had predetermined stops. This streetcar would travel from Allston Railroad Depot to Coolidge Corner and Park Square. Today, the Green Line C Branch still travels this route. This greatly increased the popularity of public transportation. Transit historians say that in the late 19th century Tremont Street was so crowded that citizens often joked that it would be faster to get to their destinations by walking along the roofs of their stalled streetcars. As a response to this, the Governor of Massachusetts and the Mayor of Boston commissioned the Rapid Transit Commission to make improvements by July 1891. The commission recommended four elevated railway lines and a tunnel for streetcars under Tremont Street. It also authorized the creation of the Boston Elevated Railway Company (BERy), which would ultimately form other railway companies in 1897. </p>
    <p class="new-paragraph">BERy was then absorbed by the MTA, then the MBTA. Despite no longer existing as a company, BERy’s influence over Boston’s public infrastructure remains substantial in two major ways: to adapt to Boston’s narrow and twisting roads, the company combined two 20-feet cars that would twist and turn in the middle to accommodate the streets of Boston. Now commonly known as articulated cars, this style of car is still used in the Green and Silver lines. The second was the implementation of subway tunnels: Tremont Street subway opened in 1897 as North America’s first subway tunnel. It is still in use today when commuters take the Green Line connecting the Boylston, Park Street, and Government Center stations. </p>
    <p class="new-paragraph">The majority of the T’s structural and financial problems arose simultaneously with the increased ridership and demand for the T. They began to realize the issues with having an elevated railway line, as the seasons would change the wiring would be exposed to harsh weather conditions </p>
        <div class="image-holder">

          <img src="Assets/Images/after copy.jpeg" alt="After">
        </div>
    <p class="new-paragraph">Central Artery/Tunnel Project (CA/T Project) also known as the ‘Big Dig’, in September 1999 the MBTA began to move the majority of the city’s public transport underground forcing the MBTA to foot the bill for billions of dollars of projects, the T cut down on maintenance to accommodate and make way for the Big Dig. The project was completed in December 2007; the Boston Globe estimated that the project cost $22 billion, including interest, and that it would not be paid off until 2038. This estimate does not include the costs related to the construction mishaps and failures. The Green Line’s Extension project was announced in 2022 to much fanfare, costing the city $2.8 billion and adding to the city’s growing MBTA debt.</p>
    <p class="new-paragraph">This has only covered the technical problems with the T, not the more nuanced problems with the T such as how it does not service members of lower-income neighborhoods. When the Silver Line was introduced, it promised to service members of low-income communities that it would be a new rapid transit that would create more opportunities for commuters to travel, reducing congestion on the existing lines. Instead, the line became a bus route. Though the line is an effective and affordable form of public transportation, it is still slower and less efficient than a rail line and fails to meet the promises made to these minority communities. Reminding riders of the much more pervasive history of Boston’s relationship with its minority communities. </p>
    <h3>Considering The Data</h3>
    <p class="new-paragraph">Incorporating community voices is vital to centering infrastructure fixes on riders’ needs. Pete Wilson, senior policy adviser at Transportation for Massachusetts, advocates for an independent MBTA board to boost accountability and transparency.</p>

    <p class="new-paragraph">For college students in Boston that rely on public transportation, the MBTA occupies a mythic, liminal space of necessity and frustration. As the primary transit system connecting Boston and Cambridge (where an overwhelming majority of the city’s colleges and universities are located), usage of the MBTA is an integral feature of thousands of students. The T’s notorious unreliability and lack of responsibility to riders makes traveling to and from class and work on any given day little more than a guessing game.</p>
    <p class="new-paragraph">With the data provided, it not only made visualizations difficult to make and slightly less accurate than they could have been, they also made it relatively complicated to clearly illustrate the impact of T shut downs and delays. The MBTA’s <a href="https://mbta-massdot.opendata.arcgis.com/documents/mbta-ridership-guide/explore">average weekday station entry</a> provides information on just how many Charlie Cards and tickets pass through gated entry, on average, each weekday. Analyzing T shutdown and delay data proved challenging due to incomplete and inconsistently formatted datasets. While initial attempts to utilize station entry data in a tree map visualization fell short due to contextual limitations, the information was ultimately incorporated into a spider map alongside station location data. This allowed for a clearer representation of station usage and its potential impact during service disruptions. </p>
    <h3>Transit Troubles</h3>
    <p class="new-paragraph">The T’s commitments to reliability and public trust are encouraging. “Repairing our infrastructure is essential to providing a safe and more reliable trip,” said General Manager Phillip Eng. He emphasized that doubling previous work to eliminate Green Line speed restrictions will enhance service.</p>
    <p class="new-paragraph">Common hindrances that Boston’s college students face include arriving late to (or outright missing) lectures, shifts, exams, and/or appointments. Trains stop on tracks without warning, station platforms fill with frustrated crowds waiting to squeeze into packed subway cars, buses at the mercy of street traffic get delayed and/or rerouted, etc.</p>
    <p class="new-paragraph">The unreliable service provided by the MBTA should also be considered for the way that it economically impacts college students. Even with a fixed fare reduction of 11%, the semester-long passes that the MBTA offers to college students cost hundreds of dollars. Students who opt to purchase the unsubsidized monthly LinkPass can expect to be set back an arguably prohibitive $90 in addition to the myriad of other financial costs associated with the beginning of each month (rent, student loan payments, credit card bills, etc.).</p>
    <p class="new-paragraph">For a system that, according to the MBTA’s own <a href="https://www.mbta.com/performance-metrics/ridership-the-t">Ridership Dashboard</a>, transports an average of 783,530 people per day (as of October 2023), substantive improvements to the T are slow-moving, and not without consequence. Beginning in early 2023, system-wide speed restrictions were instituted to compensate for infrastructural repairs, i.e. track work, signal repair, etc. Almost ten months out, these slowdowns are still in place, adding to the longstanding ire that Boston’s T-reliant population collectively experiences.</p>
      <div class="image-wrap-2">
        <img src="Assets/Images/PNG image.jpeg" alt="Student Cloud" style="width: 400px;">
      </div>
    <p class="new-paragraph">An analysis of Emerson College employee scheduling data, visualized through a WordCloud reveals the T’s unreliability frequently disrupts student workers’ commutes, hindering their on-time arrival to campus jobs. Hundreds of reasons logged over eight months on Emerson's online employee platform Sling cite MBTA delays on the Red, Green, and Orange lines as causing late shifts. Within the last fall semester alone, 25% of the reasons students listed for being late to their posts were T related. </p>
    <p class="new-paragraph">While some delays spanned just minutes, entries indicate longer 10+ minute delays occurred regularly. The frequent apologies and frustrations expressed highlight the unreliability of the MBTA system for commuting students. Overall, the data makes clear that the MBTA’s spotty service often hinders students' abilities to consistently arrive at campus jobs on time due to circumstances outside their control. Improving public transit reliability would benefit both Emerson students and the college operations that depend on them.</p>
    <p class="new-paragraph">With frequent delays and shutdowns on critical lines like the Red and Green Lines, students often find themselves at the mercy of the MBTA. As Stacy Thompson, executive director of LivableStreets Alliance, stated, “The T must prioritize projects that help move more people quickly through the entire region. There are opportunities now with new federal funding to improve service, but they must follow though.: For college students trying to balance a busy schedule of classes, work, internships, and more, an unreliable T that fails to smoothly “move more people quickly” can throw even the most carefully planned schedules into complete disarray.</p>
    <p class="new-paragraph">Ultimately for Boston-area students reliant on the MBTA, transportation remains a daily barrier impacting everything from mental health, economic stability, and academic success. Until greater investments are made and accountability measures put in place, simply having effective public transit access will remain an uncertainty for tens of thousands looking to further their education. </p>
    <h3>Students' Success Rides the T</h3>
    <p class="new-paragraph">For the MBTA and the future of Boston, getting students where they need to be should be a top priority. As MBTA General Manager and CEO Phillip Eng stated, “Repairing our infrastructure is essential to providing a safe and more reliable trip for our riders. Equally important is rebuilding public trust in our ability to deliver for them.” He added, “We know there continues to be work to do and lessons learned will continue to be incorporated to streamline efforts and better serve the public.”</p>
    <div class="image-wrap">
      <img src="Assets/Images/Station copy.jpeg" alt="Station" style="width: 400px"> </div>
    <p class="new-paragraph">While some recommendations bear substantial costs, maintaining the status quo carries its own financial risks in lost ridership, economic access and student enrollment if faith in public transit completely erodes. Boston’s next generation workforce, pioneering researchers, future leaders and beyond depend daily on MBTA trains and buses to access education. Until resolving deep-rooted problems, the T holds these hopeful futures in a delicate balance. Any city aspiring to cutting-edge innovation requires reliable mobility to help its people reach their highest potentials.</p>
    <p class="new-paragraph">The time is now for the MBTA to deliver substantive improvements benefiting Greater Boston’s students, or risk derailing the dreams powering tomorrow. The costs of inaction grow steeper with each passing day.</p>
